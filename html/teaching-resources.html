				- On the first day of class, introduce yourself to your students, and ask them to introduce themselves to you in turn. After the first day, greet students and ask them to greet you in return. Spend a few minutes going back and forth and practicing these interactions. Then, ask your students to introduce themselves to one another or greet each other. Chances are, the students will be familiar with basic introductions and greetings (if they are not, take some additional time on this exercise). However, they may have questions about the meaning of the words they use as well as questions regarding pronunciation. It is imperative that you address these questions.</p>

 
				<p><b>Write what is spoken</b> 
				- As you model introductions, make sure that you are writing words up either on the whiteboard or on a piece of paper so that your students can practice spelling and reading. Many have very limited exposure to the written word. Also, it will serve you to take the time to practice writing words with your students so that they will have the opportunity to practice. Remember that our ultimate goal is to prepare students for the citizenship exam, where they will be asked to demonstrate literacy. It is imperative that we begin investing in their literacy even at the earliest stages of language learning.</p>
